This project contains a basic implementation of a Django project (DjTweepy) with an app 'twitter_auth'. 
The 'twitter_auth' app uses Tweepy and OAuth to authenticate with Twitter, so can be extended to create twitter web apps.

To use:

Python Version 3.6 or higher !

1. Download, extract files.
2. Edit settings.py for your database settings
3. Edit utils.py to add your twitter app Consumer Key and Consumer Secret
4. Run pip install -r Requirments.text
5. Run python manage.py syncdb
6. Run python manage.py runserver
7. ???
8. Profit!

Note: this app is set up for development not production.

Note 2: please feel free to send me feedback about the Code and e-mail me back if there anything that didn't match
your Requirments,

Thanks you for the opportunity.
